# Object Oriented Programming

In this chapter I'm going to break down, in my own way, how to utilize object oriented principles to build applications that are not resistant to change. It'll be similar, but not the same, as a set called SOLID.

In school they'll tell you that the core of OOP is that you should model objects or things as classes, and those classes should contain all of the properties and methods you need to interface with that object. It's even in the phrase "**object** oriented programming". Unless you work in something like desktop application development, please forget that concept of OOP. It'll do nothing for you.

In modern OOP we treat classes as clusters of related functionality, and those classes operate on thin data structures that are defined separately. I call them thin because they'll generally only have properties and no methods.
